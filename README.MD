## Made for the ITI MiniJam**

A fast-paced vertical space shooter where you pilot a ship, collect power-ups, and build up a rage meter. When rage is full, enter a powerful state with enhanced speed and visual effects. Battle through waves of enemies, collect coins for score, and face off against an epic boss. Features dynamic parallax backgrounds, particle effects, and an intense soundtrack that adapts to gameplay.
